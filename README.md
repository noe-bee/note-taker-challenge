# Note-Taker-Challenge

## Description

- The purpose of this this challenge was to create a note taking app that allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. My main task was to create a functional back-end for the application. This included creating routes for the homepage and notes page of the application and have the server successfully allow the user to create as many notes desired and make sure the contents appeared whenvever clicked on. Since learning about back-end development, I learned that the internet is basically just servers and routes waiting for users to interact with it in order for it to get work. It is interesting to see the complexity of actually having to connect all these servers and routes with the front-end of an app and getting to see how they all work together.

## Installation

- To be able to use this application, nodejs and express should be installed to user's machine. For this project, the 'uuid' package was also used in order to create unique ids for each note.

    Express: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express
    Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/
    uuid package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid


## Usage
- The way to use this application is straightforward. The user will first encounter the homepage for the note-taking app. Upon clicking "Get Started", the user will get redirected to the notes page where they can create, save, and delete notes.
